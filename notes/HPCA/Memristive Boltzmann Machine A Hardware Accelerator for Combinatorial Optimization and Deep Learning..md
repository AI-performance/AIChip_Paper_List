Optimization and Deep Learning

**Publication:**

HPCA‘16

**Problem to solve:**

While the Boltzmann machine is applied to training deep machine learning models,
the required all-to-all communication among the processing units limits the
performance of the efforts.

**Major Contributions**

1.  This paper examines a new class of hardware accelerators for large-scale
    combinatorial optimization and deep learning based on memristive Boltzmann
    machines.

2.  This paper proposes a massively parallel, memory-centric hardware
    accelerator for the Boltzmann machine based on recently developed resistive
    RAM (RRAM) technology.

3.  Map two classical optimization problems, graph partitioning and boolean
    satisfiability, and a deep belief network application onto the proposed
    hardware.

4.  Compared memristive accelerator against an RRAM based
    processing-in-memory(PIM) system, with respective performance and energy
    improvements of 6.89× and 5.2×.
