In-situ AI: Towards Autonomous and Incremental Deep Learning for IoT Systems

**Publication:**

HPCAâ€™18

**Problem to solve:**

1.  The challenges of Cloud centric IoT systems are increasing due to
    significant data movement overhead, escalating energy needs, and privacy
    issues.

2.  The statically trained model could not efficiently handle the dynamic data
    in the real in-situ environments, which leads to low accuracy.

3.  The big raw IoT data challenges the traditional supervised training method
    in the Cloud.

**Major contribution:**

1.  Present In-situ AI, the first Autonomous and Incremental in-situ computing
    framework and architecture for deep learning based IoT applications, to
    improve the accuracy of traditional deep learning based IoT systems with
    minimum data movement.

2.  This paper is the first work to introduce incremental and unsupervised
    learning in IoT system to tackle the big raw IoT data generated in
    ever-changing in-situ environments.

3.  In-situ AI features an autonomous IoT data diagnosis, which greatly reduces
    the communication overhead and the pressure of model updating in the Cloud.

4.  Develop a novel two-level weight shared architecture for In-situ AI tasks
    and craft analytical models to guide the best configuration selection.

5.  Compared with traditional IoT systems, In-situ AI can reduce data movement
    by 28-71%, which further yields 1.4X-3.3X speedup on model update and
    contributes to 30-70% energy saving.
