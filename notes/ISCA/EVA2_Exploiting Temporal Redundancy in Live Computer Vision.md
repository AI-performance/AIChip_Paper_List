**Problem to solve:**

Video tasks consumes lot of energy and hardware, which needs to be accelerated

**Major contribution:**

1.  Design the activation motion compensation (AMC) algorithm. AMC captures
    visual motion in the input video and uses it to transform saved CNN
    activations. When pixels move in the input scene, AMC moves the
    corresponding values in the activation data. The algorithm skips a series of
    layers in the CNN by predicting their output and then invokes the remaining
    layers to compute the final vision result.

Efficient Motion Estimation: in this paper, they propose a new block matching
algorithm to estimate the motion of entire receptive fields. As for how to
choose the target layer, this choice controls both AMC’s potential efficiency
benefits and its error rate. A later target layer lets AMC skip more computation
during predicted frames, but a larger CNN prefix can also compound the influence
of layers that make activation warping imperfect. AMC choose the latest
convolution layer.

The primary control that AMC has over vision accuracy and execution efficiency
is the allocation of key frames, which are both more expensive and more accurate
than predicted frames. Several strategies exist to decide when to use each type
of frame. The simplest is a static key frame rate: every nth frame is a key
frame, and the rest are predicted frames. A adaptive strategy computes the match
error for each pixel block in the scene. When the aggregate error across all
blocks is high, this strategy allocates a new key frame.

1.  Design a new hardware module, the Embedded Vision Accelerator Accelerator to
    implement AMC algorithm.

EVA2 is not a complete CNN accelerator. Instead, in this paper, the authors
design it to complement existing deep learning accelerators.

**Lessons learnt:**

Except for frame based acceleration, maybe block based benefits for accuracy. In
the paper, the block matching algorithm considers both the redundant
computations and the receptive field, which is quite elegant.
