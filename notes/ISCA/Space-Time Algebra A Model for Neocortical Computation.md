**Paper title:**

Space-Time Algebra: A Model for Neocortical Computation

**Publication:**

ISCA‘18

**Problems to solve:**

One of the grand challenges for computer researchers is “reverse-engineer the
brain” which means understanding, and eventually replicating the way the brain
computes. The author showed another way to build a brand new math model instead
of simply imitating neuroscience.

**Major contribution:**

1.  Algebra named *space-time algebra* captures the essential features of the
    spiking neural networks.

2.  Illustration about how spiking neuron models, as envisioned by neuroscience
    researchers which can be implemented using the primitives of the proposed
    space-time algebra.

3.  Relations between space-time algebra and race logic.

**Personal thoughts:**

It seems like it proposed a new computing model for spiking neural network
(SNN). The space-time algebra which the author proposed is a math model used to
replace the network architecture in prior spiking neural network. The author
illustrated the whole idea from the neuroscience aspect and referred to a lot
related work of neural network theory research.
