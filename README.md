# About This Project

This project aims to collect and summarize the AI-related papers for readers who are interested in AI research in academia. We plan to collect all the AI-related papers in the top-tier architecture conferences such as ISCA, MICRO and HPCA in recent years. Now, we have collected them in ISCA from 2015 to 2019 with some basic analysis. These papers will be listed below and you can find our brief summaries in "/Summarys/#year_of_the_paper/". We are glad to have your suggestions of anything about this project!

# Some Statistics of the Papers
## 1.	The yearly paper count (now only based on ISCA 2015-2019 statistics)
  
<div align="center"><img width="600" src="uploads/QQ截图20200313174817.jpg"/></div><br>
The trend of AI is generaly increasing. But now it slightly slow down in 2019. And we can find out that year 2018 takes almost half of the counts, implicating the hottest year of AI accelerators.
<br>

## 2.	The countries and regions that contribute (now only based on ISCA 2015-2019 statistics)

<div align="center"><img width="600" src="uploads/QQ截图20200313174833.jpg"/></div><br>
America is definitely the origin area of most papers. China and North Korea are still two chasing character in AI research though they have done somg terrific ahievements.
<br>

## 3. Top researchers and their information (now only based on ISCA 2015-2019 statistics)

<br>
Here are the names appear most frequently on the collected papers. We collect thier public information and list below to help you find the leader researchers in this area. <br>
